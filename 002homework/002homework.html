    <h1>Human mission to Mars</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>The idea of sending humans to Mars has been the subject of aerospace engineering and scientific studies <strong> since the late 1940s </strong> as part of the broader exploration of Mars. Some have also considered exploring the Martian moons of Phobos and Deimos. Long-term proposals have included sending settlers and terraforming the planet. Proposals for human missions to Mars  from e.g. NASA, russia, Boeing, SpaceX, and the Inspiration Mars Foundation. As of 2022, only robotic landers and rovers have been on Mars. The farthest humans have been beyond Earth is the Moon.
        Conceptual proposals for missions that would involve human explorers started in the early 1950s, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place between 10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted. The list of crewed Mars mission plans shows the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space agencies in this field of space exploration. The plans for these crews have varied, from scientific expeditions, in which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a few weeks or more, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization, or other continuous habitation).

        <h2>Travel to Mars</h2>
    <p>
        The energy needed for transfer between planetary orbits, or delta-v, is lowest at intervals fixed by the synodic period. For Earthâ€“Mars trips, the period is every <i> 26 months (2 years, 2 months) </i>, so missions are typically planned to coincide with one of these launch periods. Due to the eccentricity of Mars's orbit, the energy needed in the low-energy periods varies on roughly a 15-year cycle  with the easiest periods needing only half the energy of the peaks. In the 20th century, a minimum existed in the 1969 and 1971 launch periods and another low in 1986 and 1988, then the cycle repeated. The next low-energy launch period occurs in 2033.

        Several types of mission plans have been proposed, including opposition class and conjunction class, or the Crocco flyby. The lowest energy transfer to Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit, which would involve a roughly 9-month time from Earth to Mars, about 500 days (16 months)  Mars to wait for the transfer window to Earth, and a travel time of about 9 months to return to Earth. This would be a 34-month trip.
        Shorter Mars mission plans have round-trip flight times of 400 to 450 days, or under 15 months, but would require significantly higher energy. A fast Mars mission of 245 days (8.0 months) round trip could be possible with on-orbit staging. In 2014, ballistic capture was proposed, which may reduce fuel cost and provide more flexible launch windows compared to the Hohmann.

<h2>Preparing humans for Mars</h2>
<p>NASA hopes to launch humans to Mars in the next decade or in <b> the early 2040s </b>, and the first human to set foot on the red planet <a href="https://www.space.com/1st-human-on-mars-woman.html"> <b>could be a woman</b></a>, according to former NASA chief Jim Bridenstine.

 Before that can happen, the space industry has to think up solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing the first humans to reach Mars. Gravity, for example, will be an issue, with humans facing tough conditions as they acclimatize to gravity on Mars after months in microgravity. Mars has roughly one-third the gravity of Earth, but astronauts' muscles will have degraded to the point they may struggle to walk when they first reach the planet.

    <h2>Landing on Mars</h2>
<p>A number of unmanned spacecraft have landed on <b>the surface of Mars</b>, while some, such as the Sciaparelli EDM (2016), have failed what is considered a difficult landing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mars 3</li>
        <li>Viking 1 and Viking 2</li>
        <li>Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner rover</li>
        <li>Spirit  and  Opportunity rovers</li>
        <li>Phoenix lander</li>
        <li>Curiosity rover</li>
        <li>InSinght lander</li>
        <li>Beagle2</li>
        <li>Perseverance rover</li>
    </ul>
